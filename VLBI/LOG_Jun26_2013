*Zero Levels for Signal
**Signal 1: 2.36
**Signal 2: 1.68
*We are currently tracking Cassiopeia A, but need to check how to enter offsets (azeloff=<azoffset>d,<eloffset>d) and change coordinates (Source=b[source],[hour]h[min]m[sec]s,[degrees]d[arcminutes]m[arcseconds]s,[epoch of coordinates])
*Optimizing elevation offset, trial values follow, with the average signal at each
**-1.03 degrees
***Signal 1: 3.05
***Signal 2: 2.30
**-1.53 degrees
***Signal 1: 2.7
***Signal 2: 2.12
**-0.53 degrees
***Signal 1: 2.8
***Signal 2: 2.0
**Original offset best signal, return to -1.03 degrees
***Signal 1: 3.1
***Signal 2: 2.3
*Optimizing azimuth offset, trial values follow, with the average signal at each
**+0.5 degrees
***Signal 1: 2.83
***Signal 2: 2.13
**-0.5 degrees
***Signal 1: 2.83
***Signal 2: 2.17
*Best signal at original offsets: elevation -1.03 degrees, azimuth 0 degrees
*Focusing antenna
**Moving in to the cab
***Signal 1: 3.2
***Signal 2: 2.25
**First movement further in
***Signal 1: 3.25
***Signal 2: 2.27
**Second movement further in
***Signal 1: 3.0
***Signal 2: 2.33
**Returning to first movement further in (second in the list)
***Signal 1: 3.2
***Signal 2: 2.3
**Focus at the current position
*Going to next target, B0329+54(with offset and focus as described above)
**No evidence of pulsar in signal
**Recording began at 19:03 for five minutes
**Manually edit file names before recording, as the process is slowed considerably by writing to a file that already exists
*Going to next target, B1937+21
*Observations at Algonquin ended due to signal loss
