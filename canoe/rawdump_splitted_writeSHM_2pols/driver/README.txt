This is a 2.4.27 Kernel Version.

This version is designed for memory mapping of the FPGA into user space.  It
will also work with IOCTL calls to registers for hardware where the user
space mapping fails.

Be sure to change the Makefile for the include directory for the kernel
source on your system.
